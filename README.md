# Availability Mapping Chart

This project is a simple availability mapping chart built using only HTML and CSS. It displays availability levels across weekdays and time slots in a grid layout. Different shades of green are used to represent how available each time slot is.

CSS variables are used to control the colors and make the design easy to update and maintain. A small legend at the bottom explains the color scale. This project is useful for practicing CSS variables, grid-style layouts, and visual data representation.
